		<h1>Musical career</h1>
		<p>Hardwell gained recognition in 2009 for his bootleg of "Show Me Love vs. Be".
		The song is a mashup of Robin S.'s "Show Me Love" and the instrumental track "Be" by Steve Angello and Laidback Luke.
		</p>
		
		<p>In 2010, Hardwell formed his own record label, Revealed Recordings. Soon after the launch, Hardwell started the release
		of Hardwell presents Revealed, a compilation album released annually which featured some of the label's biggest tracks of that year.
		</p>
		
		<p>In March 2011, Hardwell launched his own radio show and podcast, Hardwell On Air. It is being broadcast on various international
		radio stations. Additionally, the podcast has a spot on iTunes' Top 10 Podcasts in several countries. His collaboration single
		with TiÃ«sto, "Zero 76", was one of the biggest club tracks of that year and his first single to chart at number one on Beatport
		and on the American iTunes dance chart. In addition to multiple other hits released by Hardwell in 2011, including "Encoded" and "Cobra",
		Hardwell entered the DJ Mag at number 24.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>In 2012, Hardwell's biggest track was the solo-original known as "Spaceman", which has seen more sets, bootlegs, and remixes than any
		of his previous releases. In July of that year, he went on to perform at the main stage of Tomorrowland. As of March 2014, the performance
		holds over 21 million views on YouTube and was the most watched live DJ set on the site for over a year. It was dubbed by many as a contender
		for the best set of the year. Alongside other artists such as Alesso, Nicky Romero and R3hab, Hardwell was named an EDM artist to watch
		in 2012 by MTV. He then placed at number 6 on DJ Mag for 2012.
